# LibSimTelem
An easy-to-use, extendable, multi-simulator realtime racing telemetry interfacing library for C# .NET 4.0+

## Excuse you?
This is a reasonable response to the project desciption. Basically, many modern racing simulator games have
features that allow information about various aspects of the game to be sent, processed, displayed and/or
recorded by external applications. This library is meant to simplify access to this data across multiple
racing simulators.

## What games are supported?
Currently the library supports F1 2017, F1 2018 and Assetto Corsa. Support for Project CARS 2 is also in
the works!
